The code associated with this work is located in the 'src' folder.

By running the code, the saved weights for each of the neural network models 
will be loaded from the corresponding folder in the 'weights' folder.
Then the models will predict classification labels for the test set of the RadioML 2016.10A data set.
Finally, the model will show the various plot found in the report.

In order to train the model further, the user may remove uncomment the training blocks in the code, 
and run the program.
